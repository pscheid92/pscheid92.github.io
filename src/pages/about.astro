        </div>

        <p>
            Hi, I'm Patrick Scheid, a Senior Software Engineer at DeepL based in Munich. I work at the intersection
            of cutting-edge AI research and product development, with a focus on clarity, empathy, and pragmatic
            problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I work on the Editor Team, bridging AI research and real-world editing tools. Previously, I
            worked on the Document Translation Team, driving stability and performance improvements through technical
            analysis and solution proposals.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Role</h2>
        <p>
            At DeepL, I focus on building robust solutions at the intersection of AI research and product development.
            My work involves close collaboration with AI researchers to integrate new capabilities into products,
            turning cutting-edge research into practical, user-facing features.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            My journey in tech spans multiple disciplines, each enriching my perspective on how great products come to life:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Scientist</strong>: Developed appreciation for data-driven insights and extracting meaningful information from complex data.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Engineer</strong>: Built scalable cloud backend systems, microservices, and robust infrastructure using technologies like Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and various programming languages.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Learned the power of team dynamics, iterative improvement, and agile methodologies.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Transformed APIs into API-as-a-Product offerings, understanding user value and business impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>: Now combining all these perspectives to build impactful products effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each role taught me something invaluable that I bring to my work today.
        </p>

        <h2>Working Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe the best technical solutions emerge when teams are empowered, aligned, and deeply connected to
            the problems they're solving. My approach combines technical expertise with strong emphasis on
            understanding the "why" behind what we build, fostering collaboration, and maintaining high standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about crafting elegant solutions to complex problems—fostering clear communication,
            understanding context, and ensuring we focus not just on the "what" and "how," but more importantly,
            the "why."
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
        <p>
            I'm always interested in connecting with fellow technologists, leaders, and anyone passionate about
            building better products and teams. Feel free to reach out!
