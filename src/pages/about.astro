        <p>
            Hi, I'm Patrick Scheid, an experienced people-focused, product-minded engineering manager based in Munich.
            I believe in building not just great software, but great teams that deliver comprehensive tech solutions
            with purpose and impact.
        </p>

        <p>
            With my experience as a Software Engineer, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Data Scientist, I bring a
            unique perspective to software development. I'm passionate about building solutions that add real value
            to customers.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            My journey in tech has given me a unique perspective shaped by diverse roles across the software development
            lifecycle. I've worn many hats throughout my career—Software Engineer, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and
            Data Scientist—each experience enriching my understanding of how successful products and teams are built.
        </p>

        <h2>Engineering Leadership</h2>
        <p>
            As an engineering manager, I focus on the intersection of people and product. I believe the best technical
            solutions emerge when teams are empowered, aligned, and deeply connected to the problems they're solving.
            My leadership approach combines technical expertise with a strong emphasis on team growth, psychological
            safety, and strategic product thinking.
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about creating environments where engineers can do their best work. This means fostering
            clear communication, removing blockers, and ensuring that everyone understands not just the "what" and
            "how," but more importantly, the "why" behind what we build.
        </p>

        <p>
            My experience as a Product Owner taught me to think in terms of user value and business impact. As a
            Scrum Master, I learned the power of iterative improvement and team dynamics. As a Software Engineer,
            I built the technical foundation that helps me make informed decisions and earn credibility with my teams.
            And as a Data Scientist, I developed an appreciation for data-driven decision making and the importance
            of extracting meaningful insights from complex information.
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
        <p>
            I'm always interested in connecting with fellow technologists, leaders, and anyone passionate about
            building better products and teams. Feel free to reach out!
