            <h1>About Me</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            Hi, I'm Patrick Scheid, an Engineering Manager at DeepL based in Munich. I lead a team at the intersection
            of cutting-edge AI research and product development, with a focus on clarity, empathy, and pragmatic
            problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I manage the Editor Team, a group of around 8 engineers, bridging AI research and real-world
            editing tools. Previously, I led the Document Translation Team, driving stability and performance
            improvements while managing stakeholders through technical analysis and solution proposals.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Role</h2>
        <p>
            At DeepL, I focus on building autonomous teams that can navigate uncertainty with a human-first mentality.
            My work involves close collaboration with AI researchers to integrate new capabilities into products.
            I strive to create environments where people can work autonomously and deliver exceptional results.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            My journey in tech spans multiple disciplines, each enriching my perspective on how great products come to life:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Scientist</strong>: Developed appreciation for data-driven insights and extracting meaningful information from complex data.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Engineer</strong>: Built scalable cloud backend systems, microservices, and robust infrastructure using technologies like Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and various programming languages.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Learned the power of team dynamics, iterative improvement, and agile methodologies.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Transformed APIs into API-as-a-Product offerings, understanding user value and business impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering Manager</strong>: Now combining all these perspectives to lead teams effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each role taught me something invaluable that I bring to my work today.
        </p>

        <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe the best technical solutions emerge when teams are empowered, aligned, and deeply connected to
            the problems they're solving. My leadership approach combines technical expertise with strong emphasis on
            team growth, psychological safety, and understanding the "why" behind what we build.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about creating environments where engineers can do their best work—fostering clear
            communication, removing blockers, and ensuring everyone understands not just the "what" and "how,"
            but more importantly, the "why."
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
        <p>
            I'm always interested in connecting with fellow technologists, leaders, and anyone passionate about
            building better products and teams. Feel free to reach out!
